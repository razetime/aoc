# AOC2020-APL
My APL answers to Advent of Code 2020 questions(47/49 complete).

Advent of Code 2020 is over.

This repo contains part 1 and 2 solutions for all days except 20 and 23, which have only the first part done. Some of the algorithms used are adapted from solutions made by other people, and may not be very array-language oriented. Many of these algorithms are horribly optimized, so be warned..

[Check out the other people solving AOC in APL!](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Advent_Of_Code)

Input is taken pre-formatted as APL code in most of the files, so you'll need to figure out how the program requires it(Ssorry about that). I'll be taking input exclusively from files next year.
