# AOC2021-BQN

Advent of Code 2021 in [BQN.](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/) 

Day 22 and 23 are problems I was not good enough at to solve, so they will be done sometime later(very likely ports of existing ideas). The rest of the solutions are all complete!

This repository was written and tested on the [CBQN](https://github.com/dzaima/CBQN/) implementation.

All the documents can be runnable as `./<file>` if you have a `cbqn` executable in your path. Otherwise, `./BQN <path_to_file>.bqn` should work.
